# SHKSC | Learn At Home

__This is a project__ for all the Shkscians. If you are a Shkscian then you are welcomed to help out this project if you can. This is PWA (Progressive Web App) is a special kind of website which can be run in a device like a native application. Service workers (A special kind of Javascript Script) helps and instructs the browser to keep the app running even in offline. Traditionally, websites can't run in offline mode. But in PWAs web assets are cached in browser cache storage. As well as the service worker also gets cached automatically. It run entire lifetime of the website until the browser's cache or that individual site's cache is cleared. As PWAs are actually a website, it doesn't need that much of storage. Download size varies but mostly doesn't cross 2MB. Phone's space gets saved. These application are almost native. But they sometimes uses resource much more than their need. As these actually run with help of Modern Browsers like: Chrome, Firefox, Opera that's why memory usage sucks. But eventually this isn't an issue. 

#### Now, let's go to the app's features and topics:

This app has many features let's see,

|Feature Name|What it Does|
|----|------------|
|Authorization|Secure User sessions which prevents 3rd party entrance|
|Post|Like Facebook, anyone can post anything in __text \| image \| video \| PDF__ format|
|Realtime Communication with WebRTC| It enables us to communicate with our classmates and teacher in real time. Instead of use __client-server-client__ architecture, I'm using __client-client__ |
|Notification on any related event| User gets notified for any event with which he/she is related. e.g. Student of class 10 will get all the notifications of Classes & Examination of Class 10|
|Questions|Student can ask question, teacher or other students can answer it.|
|Activities|Any signed up and authenticated user can post any activities they like. These are like holiday post or fun posts|
|Bomb| Anyone can give anyone a __Bomb__. Bomb is considered __affection love or thanks etc..__ to that person who has posted the Post. Actually funny ðŸ˜‚ |


Above mentioned are minimum features. There are so much more feature built in that application which can be found inside help section of the help. Also features are evolving, so newer features will be added in every upcoming major updates.
